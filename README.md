# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcel!

I'm a 17-year-old student passionate about programming, electronics, and learning new technologies.  
I enjoy building small but meaningful projects that help me understand how things work — from web development to Arduino experiments.

I’m currently learning **C++**, **PHP**, and **JavaScript**, and I love combining software with a bit of hardware creativity.

Check out one of my recent projects:  
👉 [**EmptyFridge**](https://github.com/Maxiovv/EmptyFridge) — a PHP-based app that suggests recipes based on ingredients you have at home, using the Spoonacular API.

I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and improving my skills — feel free to explore my repositories!
